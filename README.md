# Real Estate Prediction Model Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for our project on predicting housing prices using machine learning. This project is specifically focused on utilizing the Boston Housing Dataset to build and train a model capable of estimating real estate prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the renowned Boston Housing Dataset. It includes various features like the number of rooms, property age, crime rate, etc., which are crucial in determining housing prices in the Boston area. You can find and download the dataset from Kaggle: [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing).

## Installation
Before running the project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. This project extensively uses the `fastai` library. To install `fastai`, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install fastai
```

## Running the Project
To execute the notebook:

1. **Download Data**: First, download the training and test data from the Kaggle website mentioned above.

2. **Data Folder**: Save the downloaded data into the `data` folder found in the `fastai` directory.

3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the notebook in your preferred environment (like Jupyter Notebook) and run the cells.
